## ðŸ’° Don't Worry About Cost

**Cloud Run Free Tier (MONTHLY):**
- âœ… 2 million requests FREE
- âœ… 360,000 GiB-seconds memory FREE
- âœ… 180,000 vCPU-seconds FREE
- âœ… 1 GiB network egress FREE

**Your NDA MVP usage:**
- Estimated: ~100 requests/day = 3,000/month
- **Expected cost: $0.00** (well within free tier)

Even with moderate usage:
- ~1,000 requests/day = **~$2-5/month**

## âœ… After Enabling Billing

Come back here and run:
```powershell
# Resume deployment
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
```
