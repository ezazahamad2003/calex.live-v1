<h2 style="text-align: center;">Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement</h2>

<p>This Confidentiality Agreement (the "Agreement"), effective as of [[DATE]] (the "Effective Date"), is entered into by and between [[PARTY1_NAME]], a [[PARTY1_JURIS]] [[PARTY1_TYPE]] having its principal place of business at [[PARTY1_ADDRESS]] and [[PARTY2_NAME]], a [[PARTY2_JURIS]] [[PARTY2_TYPE]], having its principal place of business at [[PARTY2_ADDRESS]] (together the "Parties", and each a "Party").</p>

<p><strong>Recipient's Obligations.</strong> In connection with [[PURPOSE]] (the "Purpose"), either Party ("Discloser") may disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to the other Party ("Recipient"). The Recipient shall use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and, subject to Section 2, shall not disclose the Confidential Information other than to its affiliates and its or their employees, officers, directors, shareholders, partners, agents, independent contractors, service providers, sublicensees, subcontractors, lawyers, accountants and financial advisors (collectively the "Representatives") who: (i) need access to such information for the Purpose; (ii) are informed of its confidential nature; and (iii) are bound by written confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Confidential Information than the terms contained herein.</p>

<p>The Recipient shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure using no less than a commercially reasonable degree of care. The Recipient will be responsible for any material breach of this Agreement caused by its Representatives.</p>

<p><strong>Confidential Information.</strong> The term "Confidential Information" means all non-public, proprietary or confidential information of the Discloser, in oral, visual, written, electronic or other tangible or intangible form, whether or not marked or designated as "confidential", and all notes, analyses, summaries, reports and other materials prepared by the Recipient or any of its Representatives that contain, are based on or otherwise reflect, to any degree, any of the foregoing ("Notes").</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions.</strong> Confidential Information does not include information that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives from a source other than the Discloser or its Representatives, provided that such source was not and is not bound by a confidentiality agreement regarding the Discloser or its affiliates, or otherwise prohibited from disclosing such information to the Recipient or its Representatives by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation;</li>
  <li>is or becomes generally available to the public other than through a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives;</li>
  <li>was rightfully in the Recipient's or its Representatives' possession prior to disclosure by the Discloser or its Representatives, as demonstrated by the Recipient's written records; or</li>
  <li>is or was independently developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by the Recipient's written records.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Compelled Disclosure.</strong> If the Recipient or any of its Representatives is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient shall, to the extent legally permitted and reasonably practicable, promptly notify the Discloser in writing of such requirement so that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other remedy. The Recipient shall cooperate with the Discloser in seeking any such protective order or other remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy, the Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally required to disclose Confidential Information, the Recipient or its Representative may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose.</p>

<p><strong>No Obligation; No Warranty.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement obligates either Party to proceed with any transaction or relationship. The Confidential Information is provided "as is" and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or completeness. Neither Party shall have any liability to the other Party or to the other Party's Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with respect to disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Return or Destruction.</strong> Upon written request by the Discloser, the Recipient shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, promptly return to the Discloser or destroy all Confidential Information and Notes (and certify in writing to the Discloser that such Confidential Information and Notes have been destroyed), except that the Recipient and its Representatives may retain one copy of the Confidential Information and Notes solely for the purpose of monitoring its obligations under this Agreement or as required by applicable law or professional standards. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Recipient and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Term.</strong> The obligations of the Recipient under this Agreement shall survive for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure of the applicable Confidential Information, except that obligations with respect to Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under applicable law shall continue for so long as such information remains a trade secret.</p>

<p><strong>Remedies.</strong> The Recipient acknowledges that the Confidential Information is valuable and unique, and that disclosure or misuse of such Confidential Information would cause the Discloser irreparable harm that would be difficult to quantify and for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that the Discloser shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Recipient, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a written instrument signed by both Parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [[PARTY1_JURIS]], without regard to its conflicts of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in the courts located in [[PARTY1_JURIS]], and each Party consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.</p>
