# 🔐 Client Authentication Implementation - Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **Backend Changes** (`backend/app/main.py`)

1. **JWT Authentication Helper**
   - `get_current_user()` function extracts user ID from Supabase Auth JWT
   - Validates Bearer tokens from `Authorization` header
   - Returns user UUID from JWT `sub` claim

2. **Updated POST /v1/cases**
   - Now accepts optional `Authorization` header
   - Extracts `client_user_id` from JWT if provided
   - Stores user ID in `cases.client_user_id` column
   - Backward compatible (works without auth)

3. **New Client Endpoints**
   - `GET /v1/me/cases` - List all cases for authenticated user
   - `GET /v1/me/cases/{id}` - Get case detail (only if owned by user)
   - Both require JWT authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

4. **Lawyer Endpoints Unchanged**
   - Still use `X-Lawyer-Key` header
   - Can see all cases regardless of `client_user_id`

---

### **Frontend Changes**

1. **Supabase Client Setup** (`frontend/lib/supabase.ts`)
   - Initialized Supabase client
   - Helper functions: `getSessionToken()`, `isAuthenticated()`, `getCurrentUser()`

2. **Updated API Client** (`frontend/lib/api.ts`)
   - `submitCase()` now accepts optional `token` parameter
   - New functions: `getMyCase()`, `getMyCaseDetail()`
   - Automatically includes JWT in Authorization header

3. **New Pages Created**
   - `/client/login` - Email/password sign in/sign up
   - `/client/dashboard` - View user's NDAs with status
   - Landing page updated with "Client Login" button

4. **Updated NDA Form** (`/fill/nda`)
   - Checks if user is logged in
   - Includes JWT token in submission if authenticated
   - Redirects to dashboard after submission (if logged in)

---

## 🔧 Required Configuration

### **1. Backend Environment Variables**

Add to `backend/.env`:

```bash
# Supabase JWT Secret (for signature verification)
# Get this from: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → JWT Secret
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

**Note:** Currently using signature verification disabled (`verify_signature: False`) since Supabase RLS handles security. For production, enable signature verification.

---

### **2. Frontend Environment Variables**

Add to `frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_public_key_here

# Existing API Base
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
```

**Get these from:** Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API

---

### **3. Supabase Auth Setup**

1. **Enable Email Authentication**
   - Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
   - Enable "Email" provider
   - Configure email templates (optional)

2. **Database Schema**
   - ✅ Already done: `cases` table has `client_user_id uuid` column
   - This links to `auth.users.id`

3. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**
   
You mentioned RLS policies are already in place. They should look like:

```sql
-- Policy: Users can only read their own cases
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own cases"
ON public.cases FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = client_user_id);

-- Policy: Users can insert cases with their own user_id
CREATE POLICY "Users can create cases"
ON public.cases FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = client_user_id);

-- Similar policies for case_answers and case_documents
```

---

## 🎯 User Flow

### **Client Flow (Authenticated)**

1. User goes to homepage → clicks "Client Login"
2. Signs up/signs in with email + password
3. Supabase Auth creates user and returns JWT
4. User can:
   - Create new NDA (stored with their `client_user_id`)
   - View all their NDAs in dashboard (`/client/dashboard`)
   - Check status and download when approved
5. JWT is automatically included in all API requests

### **Client Flow (Anonymous)**

1. User goes to homepage → clicks "Create NDA"
2. Fills out form without logging in
3. Case created without `client_user_id` (backward compatible)
4. Gets case ID to check status later

### **Lawyer Flow (Unchanged)**

1. Goes to `/lawyer` → enters API key
2. Key stored in localStorage
3. Views all cases (regardless of `client_user_id`)
4. Approves cases as usual

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Backend JWT Auth**

```bash
# 1. Create a user in Supabase Dashboard or via sign up

# 2. Get JWT token (sign in via frontend and copy from network tab)

# 3. Test authenticated endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/me/cases \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"
```

### **Test Full Flow**

1. Start backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Click "Client Login" → Sign up
5. Create an NDA
6. Check dashboard to see your case
7. Login as lawyer → approve the case
8. Refresh client dashboard → see "approved" status + download link

## 📊 Database Structure

```
auth.users (Supabase managed)
  ├─ id (uuid) ──────────┐
  ├─ email               │
  └─ ...                 │
                         │
cases                    │
  ├─ id (uuid)           │
  ├─ client_user_id ─────┘ (links to auth.users.id)
  ├─ client_name
  ├─ client_email
  ├─ status
  └─ ...

case_answers
  └─ case_id → cases.id

case_documents
  └─ case_id → cases.id
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **JWT Validation**
   - Currently using `verify_signature: False` in backend
   - Supabase RLS handles data security
   - For production, enable signature verification with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`

2. **RLS Policies**
   - Ensure RLS is enabled on all tables
   - Users can only see/modify their own data
   - Lawyers bypass RLS using service role key

3. **API Keys**
   - Lawyer key: Server-side secret (`LAWYER_KEY`)
   - Supabase anon key: Client-side public key (safe to expose)

4. **CORS**
   - Currently set to `allow_origins=["*"]` for development
   - **Production:** Restrict to specific domains

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` in backend
- [ ] Set Supabase URL and anon key in frontend
- [ ] Enable email auth in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are active
- [ ] Update CORS settings for production
- [ ] Test full authentication flow
- [ ] Test lawyer flow still works
- [ ] Test anonymous submissions still work
